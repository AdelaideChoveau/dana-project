# 🌍 Dana Project

*Work in progress* **Interactive Map** that will filter all the associations of Barcelona by 🔎 :
### `name`
### `area`
### `category`
### `available date`

👩‍💻 [Create with React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
👉 [Fetching API from Generalitat de Catalunya](https://opendata-ajuntament.barcelona.cat/data/ca/dataset/equipament-associacions/resource/94ed8f0c-f682-46b8-b2a4-f78697b9aa96).

### What is Dana Project ?

Dana Project will be an application that allows Barcelona citizens to search for the associations they can collaborate with.
It allows them now to search the first 100 associations of the API by name and area.

The final goal will be to add categories and be able to filter the topic that fits better with everyone as well as the day or moment of the week they could give free time to.  

### Final Project

Dana Project is a React web app built and designed by [Adélaïde Choveau](https://github.com/AdelaideChoveau) 👋
